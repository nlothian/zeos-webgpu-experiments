"""Policy-as-test: every source file carries the licence it is distributed under.

The AGPL's own "How to Apply These Terms" asks for a per-file notice, and the
SPDX short form is the modern spelling of it. The point is a file that is copied
out of this tree -- into an issue, a gist, another repository -- still says what
it is licensed as.

The expected identifier is read from ``pyproject.toml`` rather than written here
twice, so the package metadata is the single source of truth and a licence change
is one edit, not a hunt.

Third-party material is deliberately excluded: anything under a ``vendor``
directory keeps the licence it arrived with, as does a gitignored
``node_modules``.
