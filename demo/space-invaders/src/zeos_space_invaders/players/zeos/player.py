"""Play the game as a ZEOS descriptor tree instead of a prompt-response loop.

A world tick is faster than a forward pass, so the player is structurally late;
the fix is to stop the slow deliberation being the only thing that can act.
`pilot` (priority 60) reads a board and decides, served by the API machine as a
real streamed completion; `evade` (priority 5, pinned, unpreemptible) is bound
to `game.threats` through the vector table and writes a dodge as a native
behaviour, because a forward pass would arrive after the hit. The kernel decodes
and charges both the same way, which is what makes the comparison mean anything.

`ZeosDriver` is the device adapter -- sensor readings into pipes, pump the kernel,
apply the actuator, publish the world -- and the only part that touches a clock
or does I/O.
