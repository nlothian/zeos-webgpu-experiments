"""Faults, and the notices the model reads when one fires.

Faults are interrupts targeting the faulting job's ``on_fault`` policy -- the same
mechanism as any other interrupt, so error handling is also just descriptors
(core §6.2). Nothing here dispatches; this module decides *what should happen* and
what the model should be told, and the kernel does it.

Two rules from the specs shape this module:

* **Fail loudly.** Every enforcement action that changes behaviour emits a fault or
  a log event with provenance attached. There is no silent
  degradation and no silent aging -- a starved job raises a visible fault rather
  than being quietly boosted.
* **The notice is part of the behaviour.** What the kernel writes into a job's
  context when it faults is read by the model, so the text is under test, not a
  presentation detail.
