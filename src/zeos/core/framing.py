"""The kernel's frames: the tags it puts around its own text (MP §5.3).

A frame is carried on ``CONTROL`` tokens, which a machine cannot decode unless the
kernel enables it, so the frame is what carries authority. Ordinary tokens that spell
a frame tag are an imitation: inert, alarmed on as a spoof fault, and shown escaped
to a source that reads its context as text.
