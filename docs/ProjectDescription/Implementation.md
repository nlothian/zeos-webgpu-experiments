# ZEOS -- Implementation

**Audience:** engineers who will extend, port, or productionise this codebase.

The rest of this corpus is design. This document is the implementation dimension:
what is real versus simulated, where the code lives, and the backend interface a
real serving stack must implement. Nothing conceptual is defined here.

---

## 1. What is real and what is simulated

This distinction matters more than anything else in this document, and it is
maintained in the type system rather than in comments.

| Aspect | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Scheduling, preemption, suspension stack, resume | **Real** |
| Pipes, backpressure, blocking, vectors, storm control | **Real** |
| Segment table, rings, provenance, capability checks | **Real** |
| Block structure, alignment, padding | **Simulated but faithful** |
| Control-token unforgeability | **Structural** -- a `CONTROL` token cannot be decoded unless the kernel enables it |
| Eviction, stubs, page faults, store round trip | **Real mechanism** |
| **Attention mass** | **Synthetic** for the scripted backend and the llama.cpp backend -- neither can measure; the kernel resolves hints for paging, and demotes integrity on provenance alone unless a hint is a script's declared stipulation. **Measured** for `JsMachine` over the Transformers.js worker in `demo/coop-count-web`: an ONNX export of Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct sums each decode step's attention over layers and heads per KV position, under the allowed-block mask, and integrity demotes on that |
| Allowed-block mask | **Enforced** in every attention layer by the Transformers.js worker; **refused** with `MaskViolation` by the llama.cpp backend; **recorded** by the scripted backend |
| The seat's tokenisation | **Stand-in** -- whitespace, one word per decode; counts and boundaries only. The llama backend tokenises for real |
| The seat's attention hint | **Synthetic** -- a guess about the job's own output; paging uses it, integrity does not (AM §11.4) |
| Syscall ABI, parser, transcript rebuild, `MALFORMED` | **Real** -- one declaration renders the prose, the pattern and the grammar (AM §11) |
| Sink pipes and `drain` | **Real** -- the outbound mirror of `deliver`, journalled as `pipe.drained` (core §4.4) |
| Provenance of content | **Real** -- each write in a pipe carries its writer's integrity; readers, vector payloads and world objects receive the worse of that and the pipe's ring (MP §4) |

Nothing about eviction regret, θ-parameter sensitivity, or taint-creep rates can be
concluded from any run of this code. The mechanisms are validated; the policies are
not, and cannot be until a real serving stack supplies measured attention. The one
backend that measures it is a small quantised model in a browser, not a production
serving stack.

### Dependency rule

`core/` imports only the standard library plus `core/`, `world/`,
`descriptor/schema.py`, `machine/base.py`, and `nli/` -- each of which is itself
stdlib-only. It never imports `descriptor/loader.py` (which uses PyYAML),
`driver.py`, or `demo/`. `core/ids.py` is a leaf that imports nothing from `zeos`,
which is what keeps the package cycle-free. The whole rule is enforced by
`tests/contract/test_core_is_stdlib_only.py`, which checks both the declared
imports and the transitive import closure.

## 3. The machine backend interface -- where a real backend plugs in

`machine/base.py` is the most important interface in the system. Everything above it
is written against this and nothing else.

The contract deliberately mirrors the four asks ZEOS makes of a serving stack, so a
backend satisfying this interface satisfies the design.

### 3.1 The five ops

```python
def decode(self, job: JobId, *, allow_control: bool) -> DecodeResult
def inject(self, job: JobId, tokens: Sequence[Token]) -> tuple[int, int]
def trunc(self, job: JobId, at: int) -> int
def fork(self, parent: JobId, child: JobId) -> int
def splice(self, job, start, end, tokens) -> SpliceResult
```

### 3.2 The serving-stack contract

```python
def set_mask(self, job: JobId, allowed_blocks: frozenset[int]) -> None
def visible_blocks(self, job: JobId) -> frozenset[int]
def pad_to_block(self, job: JobId) -> int
def blocks_for_range(self, job, start, end) -> frozenset[int]
def transcript(self, job: JobId) -> tuple[Token, ...]
```

Four asks, all of which exist in current stacks in some form and none of which
requires model changes:

1. allowed-block bitmap fed to attention (`set_mask`)
2. per-segment attention mass aggregated per block (`DecodeResult.attention`)
3. reserved-token control in tokenizer and sampler (`allow_control`)
4. grammar-constrained decoding for endorser schemas (`Capability.schema`)

### 3.3 Division of responsibility -- easy to get wrong

- The **machine** owns the materialised token sequence and its blocks. It knows
  offsets and lengths, and it enforces the mask.
- The **kernel** owns the segment table, rings, integrity, and residency. Segment
  metadata is PCB state, **not context**.

They meet at token offsets. The machine reports what it did; the kernel decides what
it means. Getting this backwards would put protection metadata inside the window
where the model could read and forge it.

### 3.4 The attention split -- where the fiction lives

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class DecodeResult:
    tokens: tuple[Token, ...]
    request: MachineRequest
    attention: Mapping[int, float] | None      # MEASURED, per KV block
    attention_hint: AttentionHint | None       # SYNTHETIC, resolved by the kernel
    at_block_boundary: bool
```

A backend that can measure populates `attention` and leaves `attention_hint` None, as
`JsMachine` does over the Transformers.js worker in `demo/coop-count-web`.
`ScriptedMachine` and the llama.cpp machine do the reverse. Splitting them in the type system is slightly
ugly, and the ugliness is the point: it marks exactly where the fiction lives so no
policy claim can rest on it by accident.

`attention` is **block-granular** because that is what a paged serving stack actually
aggregates. Since segments are block-aligned by construction, the kernel sums per
segment *exactly* rather than approximately.

### 3.5 Implementing a vLLM backend

Order of work, roughly:

1. `create_context` / `destroy_context` → sequence lifecycle.
2. `decode` → one step, returning tokens and any reserved-token request.
3. `inject` → prefill of foreign tokens at the tail; return the offset range.
4. `set_mask` / `visible_blocks` → the allowed-block bitmap into the attention
   kernel. Target overhead **< 2% decode throughput**.
5. `attention` → per-block mass aggregation. One reduction per block; sampling every
   k-th block is an acceptable degradation.
6. `splice` → the expensive one. Report `invalidated_downstream` honestly; the
   eviction planner's cost model consumes it.
7. `fork` → copy-on-write over KV blocks.

`allow_control` maps onto sampler-side reservation. `Capability.schema` maps onto
grammar-constrained decoding.
