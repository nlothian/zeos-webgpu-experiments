# ZEOS -- A Transformer Operating System

**Status:** design draft v0.1 (2026-08-03). Name: "ZEOS" (Transformer Operating System).

## 1. Thesis

Complex, real-time, transformer-mediated systems should be programmed the way
real-time operating systems are programmed: as a **hierarchy of task
descriptors** scheduled by a kernel, with **interrupts** driving preemptive
switching between jobs, **pipes** providing both inter-job dataflow and
blocking-based scheduling, and a **stack** of suspended job states enabling
resumption.

The design slogan the whole system converges on:

> **Jobs block, never poll; the kernel wakes, never asks.**

Today's agent frameworks are cooperative multitasking at its worst: the agent
itself decides when to check for messages, which in LLM-land means a forward
pass per poll -- wasted tokens, wasted latency, and no bound on response time to
an urgent event. ZEOS moves blocking, waking, and preemption out of the model
and into a runtime.

### The robot example

A robot is executing a low-priority, high-level goal ("tidy the workshop").
A smoke sensor fires. The interrupt preempts the tidying job at the next token
boundary, pushes its state onto the stack, and dispatches a pinned
emergency-response handler. When the emergency handler completes, the tidying
job is popped and resumed -- with a kernel-inserted notice that the world has
changed underneath it (the robot has moved, time has passed) so it revalidates
its plan before continuing.

### A note on "real-time"

ZEOS borrows the RTOS vocabulary for its *scheduling model*, not for its
*timing*. The kernel guarantees ordering and bounded response in **token
boundaries**: the most urgent runnable job always dispatches next, and a
preemption lands within one decode step. It does not yet guarantee response in
wall-clock time. The kernel reads no clock; it is told the time by the driver,
deadlines are detected after the fact as faults rather than enforced, and a
decode step takes however long the model underneath takes. Wall-clock real-time
behaviour depends on a serving stack with bounded per-step latency and resident
pinned handlers, which is on the roadmap for this repository, and does not exist yet.

## 2. Core abstractions

### 2.1 Job

A job is one transformer-mediated task in flight. Its full state is:

- **Descriptor** (immutable "code"): a markdown file, §3.
- **Transcript** (portable state): the text of everything the job has read and
  generated. Survives model swaps and weight upgrades. The source of truth.
- **KV cache** (fast state): a *materialization of the transcript* for one
  specific model + weights version. Fast path for same-model resume; discarded
  or recomputed from input tokens on cross-model resume.
- **Kernel metadata**: priority, lifecycle state, held resources, pipe
  bindings, stack position, accumulated read-set, pending messages.

Descriptor + transcript + metadata = the PCB. KV is a cache of the PCB, not
part of it.

### 2.2 Priorities and the stack

- Static base priority per descriptor (integer; lower = more urgent, RTOS
  convention). Arbitrary levels -- not fixed tiers.
- Preemptive: a runnable job always preempts any running job of lower
  priority. Preempted jobs are pushed onto the **suspension stack** and
  resumed LIFO as higher-priority work drains, subject to §6 revalidation.
  Only a `READY` job preempts; a suspended job never displaces a running one,
  which is often the very handler that displaced it. But when nothing is
  running, the top of the stack competes with the ready set on priority
  (Appendix A rule 1) -- an interrupt suspends a job, it does not demote it.
- Low-priority, high-level goal jobs run only when everything above them is
  blocked or done. This is the normal idle-time behavior, not starvation --
  but see interrupt storms, §5.5.
- **Priority inheritance** on resources: a job holding a lock or lease that a
  high-priority job blocks on temporarily inherits that priority. Over pipes, which are not held -- donation follows declared relationships only:
  writers by capability, readers by stdin binding. Prevents classic priority
  inversion.

### 2.3 Interrupts

An interrupt is an asynchronous event bound to a handler descriptor via the
**interrupt vector table** (§5.1). Handling an interrupt = making the bound
handler job runnable at its priority, which (if it outranks the running job)
preempts within one token boundary.

### 2.4 Pipes

A pipe is a bounded token buffer between jobs, and simultaneously the
scheduling primitive that eliminates polling (§4).

## 3. Task descriptor format

One markdown file per descriptor. YAML frontmatter = the parts the kernel
reads; markdown body = the prompt the model reads.

```markdown
---
name: tidy-workshop
priority: 80                # lower = more urgent
model: default              # or a specific model id; affects KV portability
preemptible: true           # false only for short critical sections, §5.4
pinned: false               # true = resident handler, KV pre-filled in HBM, §5.3
budget:
  tokens: 200000            # hard generation budget; exceeding raises a fault
  deadline: none            # optional wall-clock deadline (soft-real-time jobs)
reads:                      # read-set: world state this job's plan depends on
  - robot.position
  - workshop.inventory
writes:                     # write-set: world state this job changes; named in its resume diffs
  - robot.position
  - workshop.inventory
pipes:
  stdin:  user.commands     # blocking read source
  stdout: user.reports      # replies: a sink pipe, drained for the user (§4.4)
  tools:  robot.actuators   # tool calls are writes here; results read back
children:                   # sub-jobs this job may spawn (the hierarchy)
  - clear-bench
  - sort-fasteners
on_fault: escalate          # or: retry | abort | handler:<descriptor>
---

# Task: tidy the workshop

You are the workshop-tidying job. Your goal is ...

## Procedure
...

## On resume
If your context contains a <RESUME> notice, re-read the listed world
state before taking any physical action, and revalidate your current plan
step against it.
```

Notes:

- **Hierarchy** is expressed via `children`: a job spawns sub-jobs (which
  inherit or override priority), waits on their result pipes, and composes
  them. Writing a complex system = authoring this tree of descriptors.
- **read/write sets** are declared over a namespaced world-state vocabulary.
  They drive selective resume invalidation (§6). They are declarations of
  *intent*; the kernel also accumulates an observed read-set from the actuator
  pipes the job actually read, and the union is used at resume time. A
  load-time lint warns when two same-priority descriptors write the same
  object.
- **`preemptible: false`** is interrupt masking. It must be paired with a
  small token budget -- an unpreemptible job with a large budget is a design
  error the kernel rejects at load time.

## 4. Pipes

### 4.1 Semantics

- `read(pipe, n)` -- job blocks until ≥1 token/record is available; available
  content is appended to its context. Blocking **deschedules** the job: no
  forward passes, KV eligible for page-out.
- `write(pipe, tokens)` -- appends to the buffer; blocks if the buffer is full
  (backpressure). A write to an empty pipe is a **wake event** for its reader. A
  payload larger than the pipe's whole capacity has no room to wait for and is a
  capability fault, not a wait.
- Buffers are bounded, sized in tokens. Backpressure gives automatic rate
  matching between models of different speeds with zero logic in either
  descriptor.
- `select([pipes])` -- block until any of several pipes is readable. Needed for
  any job that serves multiple sources.

### 4.2 Tool calls are pipe I/O

A tool/actuator/API call is a write to a device pipe followed by a blocking
read of the result pipe. Consequences:

- A job waiting on a slow tool is descheduled identically to one waiting on
  another job. GPU residency freed (the InferCept observation).
- The job remains preemptible while its tool call is in flight: preempt the
  job; the result waits in the pipe until resume.
- Device drivers = adapters that turn external event sources (sensors, HTTP,
  timers) into pipe writes. A delivery is all or nothing like a job's write, but a
  device cannot be parked: one that does not fit is refused to the driver and
  journalled as backpressure, never truncated.

### 4.3 Interrupts are pipe writes

Unification: an interrupt source is a device pipe with a handler descriptor
bound to it at high priority. A write to that pipe makes the handler runnable.
One wake mechanism serves dataflow, tool completion, and interrupts -- the
interrupt vector table is just the table of (pipe → handler, priority)
bindings.

### 4.4 Four kinds of pipe

Every pipe is a bounded token buffer with the semantics of §4.1. Its
declaration says which of four things it is for, and the difference is what
happens on the way in or out:

| kind | declared by | written by | read by | what a write is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ordinary | nothing extra | a job or a device | a job | a message: appended, read once, gone; received at the worse of the pipe's ring and the writer's integrity |
| actuator | `world_object:` | a job or a device | nobody need read it | a value: latches, replacing what was there, and becomes world state at the writer's integrity |
| sink | `sink: true` | a job | the driver | a history: appended, drained for the outside world |
| front door | `utterance_source:` and `reply_to:` | a device | nobody; the kernel compiles it | an utterance: compiled into a job at the speaker's authority, or nothing; never landed as tokens |

An **actuator** is the outbound half of §4.2: a write to it changes the
named world object, which is how one job's effect shows up in another job's
resume diff (§6.1) and in a status region. A **sink** is the other outbound
kind: what a job writes there is for the world, not for another job, so the
driver takes it out with `drain`, the mirror of `deliver`. The write was
checked and journalled when it landed, so what leaves is only what the kernel
let in; the drain is journalled as `pipe.drained` and wakes a writer parked on
the full sink. A job that tries to read a sink raises a capability fault: a
sink has no reader inside the system, by declaration.

A device delivery is the inbound direction on an ordinary or actuator pipe,
and is refused whole when it does not fit (§4.2). On a front door it is not a
delivery at all: the text is compiled against the descriptors' declared
utterances, the speaker named by the pipe is echoed what was understood on the
reply pipe, and a job is spawned or nothing is.

## 5. Interrupts and preemption

### 5.1 Interrupt vector table

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| source pipe | the device pipe whose write fires this vector |
| handler | descriptor name |
| priority | handler's dispatch priority |
| policy | `queue` (serialize repeat firings) / `coalesce` (collapse pending firings into one) / `reentrant` (spawn parallel handler instances) |
| min_interval | storm throttle, §5.5 |

### 5.2 Preemption mechanics and the latency budget

The transformer's natural quantum is the **token boundary** (one forward pass,
~ms). Preemption is therefore truly preemptive -- no cooperation from the
descriptor body. As a rough napkin calculation, to give a sense of where the
cost of an interrupt lands, its latency breaks down as:

```
interrupt latency = (one token boundary)              ~ms
                  + (make HBM room for handler KV)     fast with paged KV; ~0 if headroom
                  + (handler context load)             ~0 if pinned (§5.3)
                  + (prefill of event payload only)    proportional to payload size
```

Target: soft-real-time in the tens of milliseconds for pinned LLM handlers.

What token-boundary preemption cannot interrupt: a physical action already
dispatched. That requires a compiled, non-LLM reflex layer below the kernel --
a separate system ZEOS does not implement.

### 5.3 Pinned handlers (resident ISRs)

High-priority handler descriptors are **pinned**: prompt prefix pre-filled at
load time, KV locked in HBM, never swapped. Dispatch cost is then only the
event-payload prefill. This is the ISR-resident-in-RAM trick; HBM pinning
budget is a first-class kernel resource. The platform profile carries a field
for it (`hbm_pin_budget`), but the kernel does not yet enforce it and it has
not been exercised on a real platform.

### 5.4 Masking / critical sections

`preemptible: false` sections defer interrupt dispatch until the section's
token budget expires or it exits. Only for short atomic sequences
(mid-multi-part actuation, mid-transaction). The budget cap is
kernel-enforced: the loader refuses a descriptor that sets
`preemptible: false` with no token budget, or with one above a fixed limit,
so a job can only mask interrupts for a short, bounded run.

### 5.5 Storms and re-entrancy

- **Coalescing**: for sensor-type sources, N pending firings collapse into one
  handler dispatch that reads the latest value (level-triggered, not
  edge-triggered).
- **Throttling**: `min_interval` per vector.
- **Starvation control**: if a low-priority job is preempted more than K times
  *without making progress*, raise a scheduler fault (visible event, not silent
  aging -- real-time systems should fail loudly). K is
  `KernelConfig.starvation_limit` (8). The count is of preemptions since the job
  last made progress, and **progress is a request the kernel serviced without
  refusing it**: a write that landed or was parked behind backpressure or a
  gate, a read that was satisfied or blocked, a select, an acquire granted or
  queued, a release, a spawn, a page-in, an exit. Servicing one resets the
  count to zero; a request that raised a fault (refused, malformed, unbound)
  does not. What a storm denies a job is exactly this -- getting a call through
  -- so a job preempted K+1 times with no serviced request in between faults
  `scheduler_fault_starvation`, while a long-lived job interrupted now and then
  but completing calls in between never does, however many interruptions it
  takes in its lifetime. Rejected alternatives: a *lifetime* count (the
  original rule) faults any long-lived job that is legitimately interrupted, the
  opposite of a storm; resetting on *every decoded token* is too weak, because
  a storm can let a token through between interrupts; resetting on *resume*
  makes the limit meaningless, since every preemption ends in one; and
  *decaying* the count with time is the silent aging this rule exists to
  refuse. The body-eviction count (Fleet) is a separate counter and is not
  reset by progress.
- **Re-entrancy**: default `coalesce` or `queue`; `reentrant` only for
  handlers whose read/write sets are disjoint across instances. Under `queue`
  each firing's handler is handed the one write that fired it: a pipe remembers
  where each write ended, so N writes behind a busy handler are N handlers with
  N payloads, in order.

## 6. Suspension, the stack, and resumption

### 6.1 Resumption is not transparent -- the one genuinely new problem

A classical OS restores registers and the process never knows it was gone.
A ZEOS job's saved state contains **beliefs about the world**, and the world
changed while handlers ran above it. Restoring KV verbatim restores *stale
beliefs that the model will keep attending to*.

Protocol on resume:

1. Kernel computes `dirty = read_set(job) ∩ writes(everything that ran above it)`:
   the job's declared ∪ observed read-set, against the writes actually recorded
   in world state while it was away.
2. `dirty = ∅` → resume silently. The job's beliefs are exactly as it left
   them, so it is told nothing; the journal still records the resume and its
   duration. A notice whose whole content is "nothing changed" is not
   information, and it costs window that the pager cannot reclaim.
3. `dirty ≠ ∅` → append `<RESUME>` **carrying the diff**, e.g.:

   ```
   <RESUME> Suspended 1m34s. Changed state you depend on:
     robot.position: bench-3 -> doorway
     workshop.inventory: extinguisher:wall -> extinguisher:wall (extinguisher removed from wall)
   Revalidate your current plan step before acting. </RESUME>
   ```

   The kernel emits this as a single line; it is broken up here for reading.

   A bare flag is not enough -- the diff must be salient enough to override
   stale in-context state. There is exactly one resume notice, and its presence
   means something changed.

Only the state the job depends on that actually changed is reported, not
everything.

An open question, testable in isolation: do current models reliably let a
`RESUME` notice override earlier in-context world state, or does this
need training?

### 6.2 Stack discipline

- Resume order is LIFO by default (interrupt semantics).
- A handler may instead **cancel** jobs below it (the emergency invalidated
  the goal) or **replace** them (dispatch a new goal job). Descriptor-level
  `on_complete` policy on the handler: `return` (default) / `cancel-below:<n>`
  / `replace-with:<descriptor>`.
- Faults (budget exceeded, tool error, deadline miss, scheduler starvation)
  are interrupts targeting the faulting job's `on_fault` policy -- same
  mechanism, so error handling is also just descriptors.

## Appendix A -- Scheduler state machine

States: `READY`, `RUNNING`, `BLOCKED` (on pipe read/write), `SUSPENDED`
(preempted, on stack), `PINNED-IDLE` (resident handler awaiting its vector),
`DONE`, `FAULTED`.

```
                         dispatch (highest-priority READY)
              READY ─────────────────────────────────────▶ RUNNING
                ▲                                            │ │ │
                │ wake: pipe readable/writable               │ │ │
             BLOCKED ◀───── read empty pipe / write full ────┘ │ │
                                                               │ │
              SUSPENDED ◀──── preempted by higher priority ────┘ │
                │  (pushed on stack)                             │
                │ pop (LIFO) + RESUME when dirty                 │
                └────────────────▶ READY                        │
                                                                │
              DONE / FAULTED ◀──── complete / budget/deadline ──┘

  PINNED-IDLE ──vector fires──▶ READY   (payload prefill only)
  PINNED-IDLE ──write on its declared stdin──▶ READY
  FAULTED ──on_fault policy──▶ handler dispatch (same interrupt mechanism)
```

`DONE` and `FAULTED` are terminal: the job leaves the scheduler's live set, so no
per-tick scan walks it again, while its record stays for lookups by id. Its
materialised context is released by `reap`, which the driver calls as soon as a
job is terminal unless told to keep contexts for the run.

Transition rules:

1. Highest-priority job dispatches; ties broken FIFO. The candidates are the
   `READY` set **and the top of the suspension stack** -- being interrupted does
   not change a job's priority, so a suspended job is weighed against ready work
   rather than ranked behind all of it. A suspended job wins a tie: it is mid-work
   where an equal-priority ready job is between pieces of work.
2. `RUNNING` → `SUSPENDED` only via preemption; `RUNNING` → `BLOCKED` only via
   pipe ops; there is no yield -- jobs cannot volunteer scheduling decisions
   (no cooperative multitasking).
3. Wakes from `BLOCKED` go to `READY`, not `RUNNING` -- the scheduler decides.
4. Priority inheritance: a `RUNNING`/`READY` job holding a resource that a
   higher-priority `BLOCKED` job waits on inherits that priority until release.

## Appendix B -- A machine model for an LLM

A classical process is a program counter plus mutable memory, and execution
mutates memory in place. An LLM agent isn't that. The forward pass is a pure
function of the token sequence, so state *is* the sequence (we may want to add
"registers" or "slots", but that's not in current LLM architectures). The KV
cache is the process image: the materialized, resident form of that state.
Tokens are the source; KV blocks are the loaded image. There is no jump. The
program counter is always at the end.

So the kernel's entire instruction set over a context is five operations:

| Op | Meaning | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `DECODE` | extend by model-sampled tokens | one forward pass per token |
| `INJECT(x)` | extend by externally-supplied tokens | prefill cost of size of `x` |
| `TRUNC(k)` | cut back sequence to offset `k` | free, simply drop KV blocks |
| `FORK` | duplicate a context | free, copy-on-write on KV blocks |
| `SPLICE(i,j,x)` | replace a middle span | recompute everything after `i` |

## Appendix C -- Injecting interrupt return state

Given the machine model of Appendix B, interrupts become straightforward. A model
can be interrupted at a token boundary safely for high-priority event handlers.
The kernel uses two mechanisms to inject the return state of an interrupt
into a job's context.

- **Status region.** Small section within the context window that can be
  rewritten in place: `<STATUS obj> value </STATUS>`.
- **Append.** Insert a message at the next token boundary. The quantum is one
  token, so this is also the earliest possible moment; there is no separate
  "preempt and insert immediately". The resume notice of §6.1 is this
  mechanism, wrapped in `<RESUME>` and `</RESUME>` tags.
